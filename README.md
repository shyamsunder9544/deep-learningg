 deep-learningg introduction:
1, deep learning is defines about to working on complex neural networks.this topic is subset of the machine learning.
Types of layers in deep learning:
1.input layer
recieves the raw data to the machine
2.hidden layer
perform the computations in the hidden layer which is proces the data
3.out layer
provide the final output and prediction on classification
activation functions in deep  learning:
1, relu:rectified liner unit:
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
2, sigmoid:
map the values binary(0 and 1 in the layer).
3.softmax:
convert the raw data (score) convert into probability on the givendata.
back propagation and optimisation:
